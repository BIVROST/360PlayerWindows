### Why is the player crashing on Nvidia Optimus?
You need to run the player with Nvidia graphic card. Click here for more instructions. There are some Optimus configurations that may not work properly. Feel free to write to support if you encountered one of them to help us make the player better.

### I'm getting "File not supported" error when trying to play video.
BIVROST 360Player supports playback of video files and codecs based on Microsoft Media Foundation and common image formats.  
Popular video file formats compatible with the Player: mp4, avi, mov. Popular codecs: H.263, H.264, H.265/HEVC, Windows Media Video. Matroska is not currently supported. Complete list of formats is available [on the MSDN][msdn-file-formats].  
The Player also displays PNG and JPEG photos.  
However, not all formats and resolutions are supported on all systems. It depends on your configuration and Windows version. The greatest variety is available on Windows 10.

### Do I need the Oculus Rift or OSVR camera to be connected?
The positional tracker (camera) is not needed but it is recommended. It helps to re-position the headset when playback is set up to always look forward in VR. Without position tracking headset gyroscope may drift at times and cause the videos to start in a wrong position.

### Is a VR headset required?
No. Headsets are supported but are not required, You can watch the videos using your computer's screen and look around with a mouse or another device.

### 360Player won't run on Windows N and Windows KN
